        <h1>1. Earthquake Machine</h1>
        <p>
          In 1893, Tesla patented a steam-powered mechanical oscillator that
          would vibrate up and down at high speeds to generate electricity.
          Years after patenting his invention he told reporters that one day
          while attempting to tune his mechanical oscillator to the vibration of
          the building housing his New York City laboratory, he caused the
          ground to shake. During the test, Tesla continuously turned up the
          power and heard cracking sounds. “Suddenly,” he recalled, “all the
          heavy machinery in the place was flying around. I grabbed a hammer and
          broke the machine. The building would have been down about our ears in
          another few minutes.” Police and ambulances arrived on the scene to
          attend to the commotion, but Tesla told his assistants to remain quiet
          and tell the police that it must have been an earthquake.

        <h1>2. Thought Camera</h1>
        <p>
          Tesla believed it could be possible to photograph thoughts. The
          inspiration came while he was doing experiments in 1893, Tesla told a
          newspaper reporter decades later: “I became convinced that a definite
          image formed in thought must, by reflex action, produce a
          corresponding image on the retina, which might possibly be read by
          suitable apparatus.” The inventor conceived of reflecting an image on
          an artificial retina, taking a photograph and projecting the image on
          a screen. “If this can be done successfully, then the objects imagined
          by a person would be clearly reflected on the screen as they are
          formed,” he said, “and in this way every thought of the individual
          could be read. Our minds would then, indeed, be like open books.”

        <h1>3. Wireless Energy</h1>
        <p>
          In 1901, Tesla secured $150,000 from financier J.P. Morgan to build a
          185-foot-tall, mushroom-shaped tower on the north shore of Long Island
          capable of transmitting messages, telephony and images to ships at sea
          and across the Atlantic Ocean by using the Earth to conduct signals.
          As work began on the structure, called Wardenclyffe Tower, Tesla
          wanted to adapt it to allow for wireless power delivery, believing
          from his experiments on radio and microwaves that he could light up
          New York City by transmitting millions of volts of electricity through
          the air. Morgan, however, refused to give Tesla any additional funding
          for his grandiose scheme. (Some speculate that Morgan cut off funds
          once he realized that Tesla’s plan would have crippled his other
          energy-sector holdings.) Tesla abandoned the project in 1906 before it
          could ever become operational, and Wardenclyffe Tower was dismantled
          in 1917.

        <h1>4. Artificial Tidal Wave</h1>
        <p>
          The engineer and physicist believed the power of science could be
          harnessed to prevent war. In 1907 the New York World reported on
          another of Tesla’s military innovations in which wireless telegraphy
          would trigger the detonations of high explosives at sea to generate
          tidal waves so vast that they would capsize entire enemy fleets. The
          newspaper reported that the artificial tidal wave would “make navies
          as useless as the paper boats that babies float in bathtubs” and,
          foreshadowing later claims about the development of nuclear weapons,
          “by its horrors hasten the day of universal peace.”

        <h1>5. Electric-Powered Supersonic Airship</h1>
        <p>
          From the time Tesla was a boy, he had been fascinated with the idea of
          flight. Combining his knowledge of electrical and mechanical
          engineering, he began to think more about aviation after the failure
          of Wardenclyffe. In an article in the July 1919 issue of
          Reconstruction magazine, Tesla discussed his work on developing a
          supersonic aircraft that would travel eight miles above the surface of
          the Earth and generate speeds allowing passengers to travel between
          New York City and London in three hours. Tesla’s concept called for
          the aircraft to be powered by electricity transmitted wirelessly from
          power plants on the ground, eliminating the need for aircrafts to
          carry fuel. “The power supply is virtually unlimited, as any number of
          power plants can be operated together, supplying energy to airships
          just as trains running on tracks are now supplied with electrical
          energy through rails or wires,” Tesla said in the article.

        <h1>6. “Death Beam”</h1>
        <p>
          Tesla’s creative mind continued to spark new visions even late in his
          life. On his 78th birthday, he told The New York Times that he had
          come up with this most important invention, one that would “cause
          armies of millions to drop dead in their tracks.” The invention? A
          military weapon that would accelerate mercury particles at 48 times
          the speed of sound inside a vacuum chamber and shoot a high-velocity
          beam “through the free air, of such tremendous energy that [it] will
          bring down a fleet of 10,000 enemy airplanes at a distance of 250
          miles.” Although the press dubbed it a “death beam,” Tesla believed it
          a “peace beam” that would foil attacks by airplanes and invading
          armies and save lives by acting “like an invisible Chinese wall, only
          a million times more impenetrable.” Tesla offered his particle-beam
          weapon to numerous governments, including the United States, but the
          only country to show interest was the Soviet Union, which conducted a
          partial test in 1939.

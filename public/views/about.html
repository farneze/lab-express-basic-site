          Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla studied engineering and
          physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree, and gained practical
          experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental
          Edison in the new electric power industry. In 1884 he emigrated to the
          United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a
          short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he
          struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market
          his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to
          develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating
          current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents,
          licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable
          amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system
          which that company eventually marketed.

          Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla
          conducted a range of experiments with mechanical
          oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray
          imaging. He also built a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first
          ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and
          demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at
          his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures.
          Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting
          and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his
          high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and
          Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility
          of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these
          ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project,
          an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but
          ran out of funding before he could complete it.

          After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in
          the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most
          of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving
          behind unpaid bills. He died in New York City in January 7th 1943.
          Tesla's work fell into relative obscurity following his death, until
          1960, when the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the SI
          unit of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor. There has been a
          resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s.

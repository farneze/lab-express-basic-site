      <h1>About his life</h1>
      <p>
        Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla studied engineering and
        physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree, and gained practical
        experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental
        Edison in the new electric power industry. In 1884 he emigrated to the
        United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a
        short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck
        out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his
        ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a
        range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC)
        induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by
        Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money
        and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company
        eventually marketed.

        Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla
        conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators,
        electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a
        wireless-controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became
        well known as an inventor and demonstrated his achievements to
        celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his
        showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his
        ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power
        distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in
        New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the
        possibility of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried to
        put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower
        project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power
        transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.
      </p>
      <p>
        After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in
        the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most
        of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind
        unpaid bills. He died in New York City in January 7th 1943. Tesla's work
        fell into relative obscurity following his death, until 1960, when the
        General Conference on Weights and Measures named the SI unit of magnetic
        flux density the tesla in his honor. There has been a resurgence in
        popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s.
